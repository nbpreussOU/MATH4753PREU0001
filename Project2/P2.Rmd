## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(readxl)
MATH4753Data <- read_excel("MATH4753Data.xlsx")
df <- as.data.frame((MATH4753Data))
head(df)
```

## Including Plots

that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
